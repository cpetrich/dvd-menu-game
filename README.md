# Stars of Skistua
A DVD menu game that challenges you to find three stars on the playground of "Skistua" kindergarden.

The game can be played on any device that can play DVDs and show menus, including
a venerable DVD player, or
a video player on desktop, laptop, or mobile, such as [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/).

## Getting started
* **With physical DVD**: Download the ISO image and burn to DVD (Windows: right-click .iso image file and select "Burn disc image"), then play in a DVD player or app on PC/Mac or Mobile devices.
* **Without physical DVD**: Download the ISO image, start the DVD player app and open the .iso image file.

## About the Game
The goal is to find and capture three stars that are randomly placed across 14 places on the playground. Each find is rewarded with a little star animation.

Stars tend to be somewhat close to one another, so a reasonable strategy is to keep looking in the proximinity of a discovered star.

If the player takes many steps without capturing a star then a smiley will appear. Once the smiley is captured, pointers are given to the closest star. The pointers are active until the next star is captured.

Smiley and stars do not need to be captured when they are first encountered.

Where available, selecting the arrow pointing straight down will lead back to the previously visited place.

### Menu options
There are two "menus". They can be exited with the resume button on a remote control. One menu is the start screen that allows to start a new game (possibly called "title" menu).
The other menu can be opened with a dedicated button on a standard DVD remote control, or somewhere in the menu system of the app (possibly called "chapter" menu).
There are two menu options: one to request a smiley at the current place, and the other to toggle the transition videos off and on.

## If it looks odd on a conventional TV
If the view is distorted, check that the **DVD player outputs a 16:9 image in NTSC** to the TV, and that the **TV expects an image in 16:9 aspect ratio**. All modern TVs can deal with NTSC signals but DVD players sold outside North America may try to convert NTSC content to PAL. This is not an issue when played on an App.
